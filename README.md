# Zero-Age Main Sequence Stellar Structure

This repository houses a very basic ZAMS stellar structure model for graduate level stellar structure course. We have numerically solved the four, coupled, non-linear differential equations that describes stellar structure using the shooting method and the Newton-Raphson method.
